# Bankist  ðŸ’¶ 

Bankist is a fictitious and minimalistic online banking application that allows the user to:

- Log in with a username and password
- View and sort their monetary movements
- Transfer money to another account
- Request a loan from the bank
- Delete their account


Log in credentials:
- username: js | password: 1111
- username: jd | password 2222


Bugs that still need to be fixed:
- sorting transactions
